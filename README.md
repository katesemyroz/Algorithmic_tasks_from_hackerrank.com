# Description of tasks

A Very Big Sum:
You are given an array of integers of size N. You need to print the sum of the elements in the array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

Utopian Tree:
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after N growth cycles?
The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. 
T subsequent lines each contain an integer, N, denoting the number of cycles for that test case.

Modify The Sequence:
You are given a sequence of integers a1,a2,a3.....an. You are free to replace any integer with any other positive integer. How many integers must be replaced to make the resulting sequence strictly increasing?
The first line of the test case contains an integer N - the number of entries in the sequence. 
The next line contains N space separated integers where the i-th integer is ai.

Diagonal Difference:
Given a square matrix of size NxN, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing N space-separated integers describing the columns.

Lonely Integer:
Consider an array of n integers,A=[a0,a1,a2...a(n-1)], where all but one of the integers occur in pairs. In other words, every element in A occurs exactly twice except for one unique element.
Given A, find and print the unique element.
The first line contains a single integer,n, denoting the number of integers in the array. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values in A.
